## Overview

The Global Ambassador Program (GAP) is open to individuals who have a desire to learn DMC and its app Foggie, regardless of prior knowledge. A can-do attitude is preferred.

The program includes nine modules, its projects, and corresponding DMC awards associated with projects. The length of the GAP can range from 4 to 24 weeks. You are welcome to expedite your learning path and finish all the projects earlier. Upon project completion, participants are eligible for DMC or Foggie badges. Currently, these awards range from 5 DMC to 720,000 DMC. And the awards are subject to change without advanced notice.

This program is ongoing, allowing participants to join at their convenience. Once enrolled, you will become part of the Global Ambassador Group, which includes numerous experts who are ready to support you in your project endeavors. We encourage you to make the most of this valuable resource, learn from them, and most importantly establish your own DMC community.

We recognize and appreciate the efforts of those who work hard to complete their projects by awarding them badges. The highest level of achievement in the project is marked by a blue ribbon. The GAP program has two levels: GAP class & its project, and Foggie Badge Level as below:

***How to solve the members only showing as numbers?***

Answer: This is a known discord bug that can be fixed by copying and pasting the users from the list into a text channel to show their names. Please ask your invitees to chat and be active on the server, which also helps show their names.

***Why is my invite marked as fake?***

Answer：

1. They are fake

2. The account is less than 3 days old.

Please encourage the invitees to be active in the DMC server.

***How to check my invites if they are silver or not?***

Once you get your invite list, click on the user name, to find out if they are silver or not.

For those users whose usernames appear as a string of numbers, it is because they are not cached in our server，please encourage your member to be active to get a silver member. And there is no download option.

Please note the button under the list will disappear in a bit of time. If you have a long list, you may need to check fast and check several times.
